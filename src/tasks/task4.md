# Task 4

For the final task, we want you to add tests for the `createPayment` method in the `payment.service.ts` file. Please unit test this method using mocks as you see fit in the file `src/tests/payment.service.spec.ts`.

> A database instance has been configured for you, so your model / mongoose does not need to be mocked.
